## 📖 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world Security Operations Center (SOC) scenario where I:
- **Acted as an attacker**: Performed a port scan from Kali Linux against Metasploitable
- **Acted as a defender**: Captured and analyzed network traffic using Wireshark
- **Documented findings**: Created a professional report on detecting reconnaissance activity

**Primary Goal**: Understand how attackers perform reconnaissance and how defenders can detect it using packet analysis.

**Secondary Goals**:
- Master Wireshark filters and statistical analysis
- Understand TCP handshake mechanics
- Practice professional security documentation
- Build a portfolio-worthy cybersecurity project
